The purpose of these utilities is to maintain a text version of iff files to help with version control systems.

bin/iff2xml.pl - converts iff files to xml (iff2xml.pl -h for usage)
bin/xml2iff.pl - converts xml files to iff (xml2iff.pl -h for usage)
bin/pre-commit - git hook that converts any new iff file to xml
bin/post-checkout - git hook that converts all xml files back to iff

To test the utilities compare the converted/reconverted output to the original file:
iff2xml.pl test.dir | xml2iff.pl -o - | diff -s - test.dir
Files - and test.dir are identical

If the files - and test.dir are NOT identicle, then there is a problem.
